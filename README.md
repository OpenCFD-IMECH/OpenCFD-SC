The OpenCFD software series is a high-precision computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software developed by the team led by Li Xinliang at the Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
It includes the high-accuracy finite difference software OpenCFD-SC (formerly Hoam-OpenCFD), 
the multi-block structured grid finite volume software OpenCFD-EC,
the high-accuracy simulation software for chemically reactive flows OpenCFD-Comb, 
and the GPU heterogeneous parallel high-precision computation software OpenCFD-SCU. 
The developers have made this software available for use by scientific research and engineering users.
